# Getting Started

Welcome!

This document will assist organizations in using Github Actions Runners equipped with Ascend NPU chips.

If your organization would like to use the runners, configure your organization according to the [user manual](./user-manual-en.md).

If you encounter any issues while using the documentation, please submit an issue[^1].

# Future Plans
Currently, the only way to connect to NPU Runners is using Github App.
We plan to provide a Github application, such as `pr-robot`, to run NPU Runners without installing Github App and update this document accordingly.
